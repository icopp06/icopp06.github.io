  <h1>Project One</h1>

  <h3>About me </h3>
    <p> My name is Isabelle and I am from Oregon. I am currently a student attending Gonzaga university. I am working on getting my four year degree for nursing. I have lived in Oregon my whole life but was drawn to Gonzaga because it was in Washington and a good distance from home but also for the nursing program and community.</p>

    <h3>Interests</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Skiing</strong></li>
         <p> I have been skiing since I was 5 years old. My dad taught me and I have loved it ever since. I skiied almost every weekend and would go after school sometimes as well. This season I got thrity plus days at the mountain. I joined the ski and snowboard club at Gonzaga this year and bought the Ikon pass for the first time. I plan to travel around a bit and ski as much as I can.<p>
       <li><strong>Running</strong></li>
         <p>My dad is a very big runner and I started to go on runs with him when I was little. I did cross country and track through out middle school and high school. I especially enjoy going out and trail running. I live by the mountains and forests so I drive and run on the trails almost every day at home. <p>
      <li><strong>Outdoors</strong></li>
         <p>I live by the mountains in my home town and we have many lakes and places to hike. I grew up camping and spending my summer days hiking and swimming at the lakes. I have he best memories growing up and exploring the outdoors. I try to spend as much time as I can outdoors and hope to find some amazing places by gonzaga to hike and camp.<p> 
        </ul>

       <h3>Traveling</h3>
        <p>This summer I travelled around Portugal and Spain for three weeks. I started in Lisbon, Portugal and ended in Seville, Spain. We took trains around the algarve coast of Portugal for two weeks and then spent some time in Spain for a week. We went to multiple cities and towns like Lagos, Tavira and Cordoba. I went with my bestfriend and both of our moms. In Spain I met two italian girls and became really good friends with one of them and hope to visit her in Genoa sometime in summer. My dad is British so we go to Europe periodically and visit them. Last year we went to Greece and stayed at islands and then flew to go and visit my family in England after. I also go to Mexico a lot beacuse my family has a house in Cabo San Lucas. It is one of my favorite places and I have many memories there. I am excited to go and ski in Canada this summer because British Columbia is beautiful and I have always wanted to ski there. Last winter I went with my friend and skiied at Mammoth in California and the snow was amazing.  <p>

  <h3> Experience</h3>
    <p>For the past five summers, I have travelled to Montana in the summer and spend a few weeks working on a ranch. I stay on the ranch and work all day caring for the ranch and animals. I do chores, clean, work the animals, and even clean the house I stay at. Last year I volunteered in the hospital ICU in my town. I went twice a week for two or three hours. I checked people into the ICU and assisted people into the ICU. I also volunteer at a local hospice where I care and form relationships with patients during the end of life. A lot of  people dont feel comfortable around death but I think it is important to make a difference in someones life.<p>

    <h3>Skills</h3>
     <ol>
        <li>Communication</li>
        <li>Organized</li>
        <li>Quick learner</li>
        <li>Solid work ethic</li>
      </ol>

   <h3>Career Goals</h3>
    <p>I always have wanted to go into healthcare and medicine because I find it so fascinating. I like that I help people can make a difference in peoples lives. My aunt is a nurse and so was my grandma. My grandparents also opened one of the first home health care agencies in California. I am not sure exactly what type of nurse I want to be but I think traveling nursing when I am young sounds fun. I think I will also work in the ICU for a few years and hopefully can go back to school to become a CRNA or NP.<p>
